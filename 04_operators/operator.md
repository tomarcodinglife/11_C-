+ Prefix: ++x
- Postfix: x++

+ Prefix: --x
- Postfix: x--

## 6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
## This operator is used as a shorthand for if-else statements.
+ ? : (Conditional operator) Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2

## Type-Casting Operators
### These operators are used to cast variables from one type to another.

+ static_cast<Type> (Converts types at compile time)
- dynamic_cast<Type> (Used for polymorphism and downcasting)
+ const_cast<Type> (Used to add or remove const qualifier)
- reinterpret_cast<Type> (Used for low-level reinterpreting of data)

## Pointer Operators
### These operators are used with pointers to manipulate memory addresses.
+ (Address-of operator, gets the memory address of a variable)-> & 
- (Dereference operator, accesses the value at a pointer's address) -> * 

## Sizeof Operator
### This operator is used to determine the size (in bytes) of a data type or object.
+ (Returns the size in bytes) sizeof 

## Comma Operator
### This operator allows you to evaluate multiple expressions, where each expression is separated by a comma, and the result of the last expression is returned.

+ (Comma operator) - , 

## Scope Resolution Operator
### This operator is used to define the scope of variables or functions, especially to access global variables or class members.

+ (Scope resolution) :: 

## Member Access Operators
### These operators are used to access members (variables or functions) of a class or struct.
+ (Dot operator, for accessing members of an object)  .
- (Arrow operator, for accessing members of a pointer to an object)   -> 

## New and Delete Operators
### These operators are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
+ (Allocates memory dynamically) new 
- (Deallocates dynamically allocated memory) delete 
+ (Allocates memory for an array) new[] 
- (Deallocates memory for an array) delete[] 

## Exception Handling Operators
### These operators are used for exception handling.
+ (For handling exceptions) try, catch, throw
